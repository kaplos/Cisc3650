# Event Board

This is a group website project for the CISC 3650 Human Computer Interaction course in Fall 2023. The branding for the site uses the logotype "B.C. Event Star".

## Description

This website is intended to be a place where members of the Brooklyn College community can find events related to campus clubs, performing arts, job seekers, and other college activities. 

## Limitations

This website only presents the front-end functionality, with a simulated back-end. There are interactive elements, but there is not a working back-end. This means that there isn't a server with actual event information, and any changes made by the user are only saved locally, and not to a server.

## Website Link

The website can be found at on [Github Pages](https://kaplos.github.io/Eventboard/)
